# N8NTemplates


150+ Industry-Specific Workflows – A Vault of Automation Systems I’ve Built, Tested, and (Sometimes) Sold. Others? Just Born from Boredom.

What’s Inside This Digital Vault:
🏠 Real Estate – High-converting lead nurturing system.
🚗 Automotive – Smart inventory bots tracking real-time pricing across multiple dealerships.
🎨 Creative Content – YouTube-to-TikTok engines that churn out 47 clips while you sleep.
📊 Data Analytics – Competitor analysis tools that uncover hidden content opportunities.
💰 E-commerce – Full-funnel customer journey automations that turn visitors into buyers.
📧 Email Automation – SDR bots that handle outreach and close deals with zero human effort.
🏥 Healthcare – HIPAA-compliant patient follow-up sequences ready to deploy.
👥 HR & Recruiting – Candidate screening workflows that save teams hours of manual work.
⚖️ Legal Tech – Document automation systems saving law firms thousands in admin time.
📱 Social Media – Engagement bots that actually build real, loyal communities.
✈️ Travel – Booking optimization engines used by modern travel agencies.

Here’s the truth:
Half of these workflows are proven revenue generators I’ve already sold. The other half? Experiments that accidentally turned into client goldmines. And every single one is plug-and-play.

What sets this apart?
Most people sell you outdated templates and broken logic nodes. These? They're updated, tested in real-world scenarios, and designed to be profitable from day one.

From study-helper bots (because traditional education is broken) to complex inventory systems for manufacturers — this vault touches every industry that matters… and a few that really don’t.
