![file-000000001ef8620a8ba317d9667650a7](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3bb015b-e5c0-4b62-9ff2-7c3e367361c0)



150+ Industry-Specific Workflows – A Vault of Automation Systems I’ve Built, Tested, and (Sometimes) Sold. Others? Just Born from Boredom.

What’s Inside This Digital Vault:
🏠 Real Estate – High-converting lead nurturing system.
🚗 Automotive – Smart inventory bots tracking real-time pricing across multiple dealerships.
🎨 Creative Content – YouTube-to-TikTok engines that churn out 47 clips while you sleep.
📊 Data Analytics – Competitor analysis tools that uncover hidden content opportunities.
💰 E-commerce – Full-funnel customer journey automations that turn visitors into buyers.
📧 Email Automation – SDR bots that handle outreach and close deals with zero human effort.
🏥 Healthcare – HIPAA-compliant patient follow-up sequences ready to deploy.
👥 HR & Recruiting – Candidate screening workflows that save teams hours of manual work.
⚖️ Legal Tech – Document automation systems saving law firms thousands in admin time.
📱 Social Media – Engagement bots that actually build real, loyal communities.
✈️ Travel – Booking optimization engines used by modern travel agencies.




Here’s the truth:
Half of these workflows are proven revenue generators I’ve already sold. The other half? Experiments that accidentally turned into client goldmines. And every single one is plug-and-play.

What sets this apart?
Most people sell you outdated templates and broken logic nodes. These? They're updated, tested in real-world scenarios, and designed to be profitable from day one.

From study-helper bots (because traditional education is broken) to complex inventory systems for manufacturers — this vault touches every industry that matters… and a few that really don’t.

Why 95% of n8n Workflows Fail (and How to Build the 5% That Actually Work)

95% of n8n workflows die within 48 hours.
I’ve seen people dive into automation with the excitement of a kid on Christmas morning—only to abandon it faster than a bad Tinder date.

Here’s why most workflows break—and how the 5% that succeed avoid the trap:

🔄 The "I’ll Figure It Out" Spiral
Most folks treat n8n like IKEA instructions: ignored. The result? A digital Frankenstein that confuses your customers more than it converts them.

📦 Template Junkies
Copying workflows off YouTube without understanding each node is like doing surgery because you watched Grey’s Anatomy. Lucky? Maybe. Dangerous? Definitely.

🚨 No Error Handling
Your workflow works great… until one API changes, a service hiccups, or someone sends junk data. Suddenly your “automation” becomes a full-time cleanup job.

🔧 Solutions in Search of Problems
“Look, it can do everything!” Cool. But can it make you money? A simple workflow that delivers real value beats a complex one that impresses no one.

🧪 Testing in a Bubble
Running flawless tests with clean data in your room isn’t the same as dealing with real-world users typing “asdfghjk” as their phone number.

💡 The difference between builders who quit and builders who win?
Planning.
Document your process. Map your data flow. Add error handling on day one.

Not because it’s fun (it’s not), but because broken automation is worse than no automation.

Your call:
Spend 30 minutes planning or 30 hours debugging.

Your weekend challenge:
Pick an industry.
Copy a workflow.
Hit "Run."
Start printing results. 💸
